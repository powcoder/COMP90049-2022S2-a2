    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should implement functions for the skeletons listed below. You may implement any number of additional (helper) functions. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficiency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it. We reserve the right to deduct up to 4 marks for unreadable or excessively inefficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 of the marks available for this Project will be assigned to whether the five specified Python functions work in a manner consistent with the materials from COMP90049. Any other implementation will not be directly assessed (except insofar as it is required to make these five functions work correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "13 of the marks will be assigned to your responses to the questions, in terms of both accuracy and insightfulness. We will be looking for evidence that you have an implementation that allows you to explore the problem, but also that you have thought deeply about the data and the behaviour of the Naive Bayes classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via Canvas. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced on the discussion board (Piazza -> Assignments -> A2); we recommend you check it regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: While you may discuss this homework in general terms with other students, it ultimately is still an individual task. Reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. Please check the <a href=\"https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/126693/modules#module_734188\">CIS Academic Honesty training</a> for more information.

    "1. Do **not** shuffle the data set\n",
    "2. Treat the features as nominal and use them as provided (e.g., do **not** convert them to other feature types, such as numeric ones). Implement a Naive Bayes classifier with appropriate likelihood function for the data.\n",
    "3. You should implement the Naive Bayes classifier from scratch. Do **not** use existing implementations/learning algorithms. You must use epsilon smoothing strategy as discussed in the Naive Bayes lecture. \n",
    "4. Apart from the instructions in point 3, you may use libraries to help you with data reading, representation, maths or evaluation.\n",
    "5. Ensure that all and only required information is printed, as indicated in the final three code cells. Failure to adhere to print the required information will result in **[-1 mark]** per case. *(We don't mind details like you print a list or several numbers -- just make sure the information is displayed so that it's easily accessible)*\n",
